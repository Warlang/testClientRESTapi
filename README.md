# testClientRESTapi
Client for the REST API OMDb- The Open Movie Database

This tiny project is made using Android Studio, made to demonstrate the relations between GUI, REST API and system backend to show collaboration. This is an android application that run on smartphones.

To work you need to make a key request to http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx to require your own personal key.
I switched mine to a "dummy" key, free keys are avaialble but can only be used for 1000 repsonses per day.

The HandlerURL class has the dummy key that need to be updated to yours.
